        DESCRIPTION:
        The Master contract will be owned by SARegistry. This is a contract factory which
        allows us to deploy new instances of the Company contract when reputable companies
        want to be added onto the platform. These companies will be able to record payment
        histories, so they will need to be vetted first.
